            To ensure the security of your funds and the stability of the
            platform, we have made some important security upgrades. We
            particularly focused on user withdrawal address management.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            From now on, when users make withdrawals and their total USDT or TRX
            value exceeds 1000 USD, and if they are using a withdrawal address
            that is not the previously used unique address, they will need to
            contact customer service for additional confirmation.

            To facilitate a smooth withdrawal process, please make sure you have
            received the verification email and found the correct verification
            code before using the new withdrawal address. If you haven't

        <div className="announcement-detail">
          <p>Hi CoinRyze family,</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            I just wanted to offer a few tips to keep your account and funds
            super secure:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            1. **Protect your email** üìß: Your email is key to recovering your
            account and getting withdrawal codes. Use a strong password and
            enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            2. **Keep your account information private** ü§´: Never share your
            login details or private keys with anyone, and remember, CoinRyze
            employees will never ask for this information.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            3. **2FA is a must** üîë: An extra layer of security never hurts.
            Enabling 2FA keeps your account locked down, even if your password
            is compromised.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            4. **Beware of phishing sites** üé£: Always double-check the URL to
            make sure you are on our official website
            **[CoinRyze.org](http://coinryze.org/)**. Don't be fooled by fakes.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            5. **Withdrawal Email Verification** üì©: To ensure it's really you,
            we'll ask you to send a verification code to your email when you
            withdraw.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Remember:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>- Change your passwords often and keep them complex.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>- Avoid logging in on public WiFi.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>- Protect your devices with antivirus software.</p>

          <p>If you have any questions or need help, we're here for you.</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            <strong>1. Do Not Share Your Account Information:</strong>{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Please refrain from sharing any sensitive information, including
            your username, password, verification codes, with anyone, even if
            they claim to be platform customer service or other related
            personnel. Our customer service team will never ask you for your
            password or other sensitive information.

          <p></p>

            <strong>
              2. Exercise Caution with Spam Emails and Phishing Links:
            </strong>{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Handle emails with caution, especially those from unknown senders.
            Avoid clicking on any links contained in such emails to prevent
            falling victim to phishing websites. Ensure that all your operations
            are conducted only on the official platform or website, and avoid
            providing personal information via email or other channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3. Beware of Trojan Files and Malicious Software:</strong>{" "}

          <p>
            Do not download, open, or execute files from strangers, particularly

            software that could lead to the compromise of your account
            information or other security issues.

          <p>
            To enhance the security of your account, we recommend changing your
            password regularly. Ensure that your password is complex,
            incorporating a combination of letters, numbers, and special
            characters. Avoid using easily guessable passwords such as birthdays
            or names.
